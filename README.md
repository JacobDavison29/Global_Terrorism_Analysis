# Project Description
Analysis on global terrorism data. Using MS SQL Server to explore and get an understanding of the dataset. Utilizing Tableau to create a dashboard that summarizes the key points in the data.

# Important Things to Note About This Project
  - The data set combined North Africa and the Middle East together when dividing the data into regions. When taking totals for continents the numbers for the Middle East were totaled into Africa.
  - In the MS SQL Server queries the continent of Asia is sometimes represented as AI instead of AS to avoid usings words deemed as keywords by SQL Server.

# About the Data
The global terrorism dataset was found on Kaggle and is located [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd). The data consists of 181,691 data points that describe in depth different terrorism attacks that have taken place around the world between 1970 and 2017. 

# Project Fidings

My analysis of this dataset has led to some key findings that I find particularly intriguing.
  - North America has the highest success rate of terrorism attacks being carried out with that success rate being 93%. 
  - The most common types of terorrism attacks globally are Bombings/Explosions.
  - The country with the most deaths per year from terrorist attacks is Iraq, however it is projected that Afghanistan will surpass Iraq in the coming years.
  - The continent with the most deaths from terrorism attacks is Africa.
  
The overall analysis of the data can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jacob.davison/viz/GlobalTerrorismData_16619501106310/Dashboard1) on my Tableau Profile.
